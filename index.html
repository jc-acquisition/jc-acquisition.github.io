        <h1>Test Website</h1>
        <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
        <p>Here is some additional text. Is there a way to factor out text from the html slide?<br>
            I'm not sure I like editing text within a text editor.<br>
            How does creating <strong>new lines</strong> impact the look of the page? Is new line considered an element?
